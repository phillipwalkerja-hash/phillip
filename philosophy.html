    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
<div class="other-section">
<pre>
I believe that technology, when used purposefully and 
responsibly, is a powerful tool for enhancing teaching 
and learning. My personal philosophy for using technology 
in education is centered on improving student engagement, 
promoting critical thinking, and preparing learners to 
function effectively in a digital world. Technology should 
not replace good teaching; instead, it should support 
meaningful learning experiences that are student-centered, 
interactive, and relevant to real-life situations.

Guided by the ISTE Standards, I strive to create learning 
environments where students are empowered as knowledge 
constructors and creative communicators, using digital
 tools to research, analyze information, and express their
 ideas in diverse ways. I believe students should also 
develop skills as **digital citizens**, learning to use 
technology ethically, safely, and responsibly while 
respecting others in online spaces. As an educator, I aim 
to model effective technology use by being a learner 
myself—continuously exploring new tools—and by acting as a 
facilitator who uses technology to personalize learning and 
encourage collaboration.

Additionally, I believe technology should be inclusive and 
accessible, supporting diverse learning needs and learning 
styles. It should be used to bridge gaps, not widen them, 
by providing equal opportunities for all students to 
participate and succeed. Assessment through technology 
should be ongoing and formative, allowing both teachers and 
students to track progress and reflect on learning. Ultimately, 
my goal is to use technology to create engaging, ethical, and 
future-ready learning experiences that equip students with the 
skills, confidence, and adaptability needed for the 21st 
century.
